# jQuery: Nuts, Bolts and Bling â€“ Live Coding Source Code

This code was used in the jQuery: Nuts, Bolts and Bling presentation delivered at
[Front End Design Conference](http://frontenddesignconference.com) in St. Petersburg, FL.

**Important!** Because we are using AJAX, you cannot run this at the `file://` protocol in some browsers. To run this code you need to run it at `http://`. The easiest way to do this is to upload it to a personal website and play with it there. The next easiest (If you are on a Mac), is to open Terminal and navigate to the directory where this file lives. Then run:

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Then point your browser to [http://0.0.0.0:8000](http://0.0.0.0:8000) and try out the files.

Most of this code was revealed during the live coding session. Only the result remains in this
source code format (With the exception of some of the steps used in the `doTimeout` section). Here are a few notes about the concepts presented:

## jQuery Mockjax

We use the [Mockjax](http://code.appendto.com/plugins/jquery-mockjax) plugin to fake a request
to the [Dribbble API](http://dribbble.com/api) and return test data.

The process for generating our test data file (`mocks/johnneiner.js`) was:

1. Visit the API endpoint on the Dribbble api, in this case: `http://api.dribbble.com/players/johnneiner/shots`
2. Save this file as `mocks/johnneiner.js`
3. Open the file and add `var johnneiner = ` to the beginning, and `;` at the end.
4. Include this new js file on our page with our mocks

*We are simulating a cross domain request and I ran into some issues using the normal mockjax `proxy` method, so I took this approach instead. If I find a better workaround, or mockjax is updated to make this easier, I will try to update this repository to reflect that.*

Then, you add the code found in `mocks/mocks.js`

To test that our fake data works like the real data, simply remove the three mock `<script>` tags from `index.html`.

## jQuery Tmpl

The point of showing [this plugin](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-tmpl) was not to say this is the end-all of templating libraries for JS, but instead to show the concept of separating HTML from JavaScript in a clear way. This code is also in its final state from the presentation, but you can see the important pieces in the `script#shot-template` in `index.html`, and also in the first section of code in `js/script.js`.

## jQuery doTimeout

Ben Alman's [jQuery.doTimeout] plugin makes dealing with timers almost effortless. During the live coding session, we looked at how to implement this plugin to get some great results.

If you want to follow along on the progression we took during the live coding session, visit the bottom of `js/script.js` and one by one uncomment `first_try`, `second_try`, etc. Be sure to only have one uncommented at a time. Don't leave `first_try` and `third_try` running at the same time, for instance.

`final_try` is of course the final working interaction. The comments in the `script.js` file explain about the expected interactions at each stage, and any problems you might see during that time.
